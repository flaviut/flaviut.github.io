title: "Minimal ESP8266 schematic"

I had a lot of trouble finding a correct & minimal ESP8266 schematic, so here's
what I've ended up with:

## ESP-WROOM-02

{% include image.html

    description="" %}

- To program, hold SW1 while connecting the power pin. RST is not connected.
- It is possible to use IO0 and IO15 for other things, but to figure out how to
  do that, you'll need to dig deeper into [the manual][wroom-02-man].
- There's an RC filter on EN to ensure the power supply is fully up before
  booting the ESP8266.
